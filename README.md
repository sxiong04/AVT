##### Sprint Rectrospective
###### What went well?
###### I think overall when we did start the assignment, things were pretty well. We were open to each others ideas and seeing how each of us wanted to implemented a feature. Then, seeing which one might be the best implementation based on how the code was structured. I think we learned a lot from the process despite not getting all the functionality we wanted to have, we learned a lot of new thing about working with unfamilar code. Communication of learning about the project code and how each one of us is implementing the functionality was pretty good. 
###### What could of been better/improved?
###### Communication between the team could of been better (splitting up work and members taking responsiblity for certain functionality) and starting on the assignment slightly sooner. We wanted to add three main functionality to the web application (Multidestination, Wait time, and Robot roaming/disappearing). We only got done with the first two (Multidestination and Wait time) and we ran into some issues/confusions when trying to implement robot roaming/disappearing and ran out of time. One group member did majority of the implementation and if communication was better,  so we might of gotten what we wanted to implement.
